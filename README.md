#Machine Learning Project - Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression and KNN
Built machine learning models using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify diabetes cases. Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering, to enhance data quality. Applied Grid Search to tune hyperparameters for both models, optimizing performance. Employed L1 regularization in Logistic Regression for feature selection, identifying the most impactful predictors. Evaluated models on test data, comparing accuracy before and after feature selection, and visualized results using confusion matrices. This project demonstrated effective use of data processing, model tuning, and evaluation techniques to improve predictive accuracy.
